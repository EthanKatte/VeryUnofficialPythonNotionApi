# VeryUnofficialPythonNotionApi
This is a set of methods that are useful when trying to manipulate the Notion web API through Python. This is a VERY unofficial program, and is predominately used for my own development and exploration.


# GETTING STARTED
To get started create a new integration with notion at https://www.notion.so/my-integrations and generate an API Key
Copy that API Key into the config.json file.
Python is now linked to your notion account. 

This program has no UI yet. To get blockID's or pageID's referenced in the code, open notion and click the `copy link to block` or `copy link to page` and get the encrypted string at the end of the URL. 
That is the ID for the element.

## use https://pypi.org/project/notion/ for anything important
